- 👋 Hi, I’m @richardsonemmae!
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from Bartending/Managment and Small Business Ownership to a position in Web Development.  I enjoy skydiving, hiking, running, cooking, and learning new things that test me and push my limits.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Junior Level Front End Development Projects to prepare me to work as a Frontend Web Developer.
